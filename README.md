1. Device dependent. Some devices only support display control via IR.
2. Experimental. "Follow Me" requires the IR remote to transmit temperature data. More info [here](https://github.com/mill1000/midea-msmart/pull/91).

## Install Via HACS
[![Install via HACs on your Home Assistant instance.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=mill1000&repository=midea-ac-py&category=integrations)

Or search HACS integrations for "Midea Smart AC".

## Install Manually
1. Locate the `custom_components` directory in your Home Assistant configuration directory. It may need to be created.
2. Copy the `custom_components/midea_ac` directory into the `custom_components` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration
Midea Smart AC is configured via the GUI. See [the HA docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/integration/) for more details.

Devices can be automatically discovered and configured or manually configured.

### Automatic Configuration
For automatic configuration, select "Discover devices". Leave the host field blank to search the local network, or provide an IP/hostname to configure a specific device.

### Manual Configuration
For manual configuration, select "Configure manually". Enter the device ID, IP, and port. V3 devices require the token and key parameter. This information must be [acquired manually](#getting-device-info).

---
Name | Description | Required | Example 
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
**ID** | Device ID | Yes | 123456789012345
**Host** | Device IP address | Yes | 192.168.1.100
**Port** | Device port | Yes | 6444
**Token** | Device token | For V3 devices | ACEDDA53831AE5DC... (Length 128)
**Key** | Device key | For V3 devices | CFFA10FC... (Length 64)

## Integration Options
Additional options are available to tweak integration behavior per device.

---
Name | Default | Description 
:--- | :--- | :--- 
**Beep** | True | Enable beep on setting changes.
**Temperature Step** | 1.0 | Step size for temperature set point.
**Use Fan-only Workaround** | False | Enable this option if device updates cause the device to turn on and switch to fan-only.
**Show All Presets** | False | Show all presets regardless of device's reported capabilities.
**Additional Operation Modes** | Empty | Additional HVAC modes to make available in case the device's capabilities are incorrect.
**Maximum Connection Lifetime** | Empty | Limit the time (in seconds) a connection to the device will be used before reconnecting. If left blank, the connection will persist indefinitely. If your device disconnects at regular intervals, set this to a value below the interval.

## Getting Device Info
Use the `midea-discover` command from [msmart-ng](https://github.com/mill1000/midea-msmart) to obtain device information.
```shell
pip install msmart-ng
msmart-ng discover
```
Check the output to ensure the type is 0xAC and the `supported` property is True.
